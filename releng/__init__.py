Jenkins build scripts

Jenkins uses the scripts in this package to do builds.
The main interface for Jenkins is to import the package and use run_build().
Other functions defined here are used from workflow builds, and typically
return values are passed through StatusReporter back to the workflow build
(using a temporary file, since that is by far the simplest way to pass
information back).
For testing, the package can also be executed as a command-line module.

    repository to a :file:`releng/` subdirectory of the workspace, and
    the repository that triggered the build, similarly in a subdirectory of the
    workspace.

    See :doc:`releng` for more details on the general build organization.
